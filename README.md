# CatRadar

CatRadar is a full stack app with the frontend built in React and a backend that uses NodeJS and Express.

Me and my friends as cat people like to share street cat pictures with each other.  And one I thought why not create a real app with all Amsterdam's cats that you can meet on the street. As a user, you can upload not only a picture but also a location where this cat was cathed. Main idea of my app, just shre your hapiness with each other. 
If you are bored duiring your walks, you can always play in "Pokemon - go" but with real cats. 
Is it not fun?


Here is a link to the deployed app: https://car-radar.netlify.app/
